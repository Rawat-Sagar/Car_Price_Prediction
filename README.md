Car Price Prediction web api or other website are used when there is high chances that you are selling your car for the right price.

Here is the some more info about the dataset which I used to do this project:
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
     The columns in the given dataset are as follows:
     1.name
     2.year
     3.selling_price
     4.km_driven
     5.fuel
